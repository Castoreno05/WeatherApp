# WeatherApp

For this application, enter a city into the search bar to learn weather conditions.

Once the search has been made you will be given 2 results, the current weather and a 5-day forecast.

With these results you can learn the temperature, wind-speed, and humidity. Each day will also provide 

an icon to represent the weather conditions. After a search has been made, a button will populate 

under the search button. Use these buttons as shortcuts to view recently searched cities.
